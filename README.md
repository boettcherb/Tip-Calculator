# Tip Calculator
This is a small app written in HTML / CSS / JS. I created this mainly as a learning experience, but someone might get some use out of it. If someone is at a restaurant they can input the amount owed on their bill, rate their service, and give number of people paying, and this app will calculate a tip amount. The values given are based on the standard of a 15% - 20% tip for good service.

## Project Idea
I found the inspiration for this project on [this website](https://skillcrush.com/blog/projects-you-can-do-with-javascript/) while searching for ways to practice writing HTML / CSS / JS. There are some other nice ideas on there that might be worth checking out if you are also looking for practice.
